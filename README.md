How does it work ?
==================

Trac.kr is essentially a scalable web service using Ruby with Rails that keeps track of goals that the user wants to achieve in areas like hobbies, socializing, family, health, ﬁnancial planning, etc. A Social dimension is added to it via integration with social networks like facebook, twitter, etc whereby your friends can oﬀer suggestions, cheer you on or join in your goal, etc.
